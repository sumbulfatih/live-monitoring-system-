# live-monitoring-system-

In this project, a live detection was performed using thermopile sensor. The thermopile sensor is equipped with a kind of thermal imager. The creatures with a certain temperature in the range can be detected by the sensor via their heat, also the movement of the creature can be observed as well.

Thermopile sensor is provided arduino connection through I2C protocol. It was opened to the internet through Nodemcu. Using the MQTT communication protocol, the image obtained by the thermal sensor is displayed on mobile and web applications.
